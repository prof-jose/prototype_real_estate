# Prototype-based learning for real estate data

This is the code necessary to reproduce the experiments in the article "Predicting real estate proces with prototype-based models". 

This repository only contains the scripts necessary to reproduce the results; the data and model can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/prof-jose/prototype_based_learning).
